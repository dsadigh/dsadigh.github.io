        <p align = "justify">
        While the vast majority of methods and tools in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been developed for fully autonomous systems, most engineered systems operate with a human on-the-loop, if not in-the-loop.  A pervasive history of incidents and accidents in aircraft flight management systems, air traffic control, automobile systems, biomedical systems and devices, and other application domains attest to the unaddressed challenges inherent in the design of human-cyber-physical systems (HCPS).  Transparency, trust, situational awareness, workload, and other factors have significant influence on overall system performance when humans interact with automation.  
        </p>
        <p align = "justify">
          Methods and tools for design of HCPS must account for the complexity of the human response, as well as challenges associated with accurate assessments of human state, incorporation of biometric data into the control loop, and effective communication and collaboration with the human. Interdisciplinary challenges arise in the need for modeling, simulation, and experimental validation.  
        </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        This workshop seeks to envision the future of HCPS research.  We aim to identify the most relevant challenges facing cyber-physical system researchers in HCPS, including (but not limited to) problems in human-robot interaction, societal-scale infrastructure, semi-autonomous vehicles and transportation systems, and neuro or mechanical assistive devices.

        <h2 id="format">Workshop Format</h2>
         <p align = "justify">
        The workshop format exploits interactive elements.  After a brief introduction, invited speakers will give brief, 3-minute talks on their vision for the most significant research problems in HCPS.  Participants will then break into small groups to discuss a series of open-ended questions.  After re-joining, groups will quickly summarize novel findings to all participants, and organizers will provide concluding remarks.

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion Groups</h2>
         <p align = "justify">
           <b>Humans and Robots</b> will focus on questions motivated by problems in human-robot interaction, collaboration, and communication, neuromechanical systems, assistive and rehabilitative robotics, teleoperation, and neurological and biomedical modeling.  
        </p>
        <p align = "justify">
           <b>Humans and Methods</b> will focus on questions motivated by problems in verification and control, including extension of formal methods to HCPS, synthesis of controllers for human-on-the-loop systems, and collaborative and shared control.

His primary research interests are in the fields of haptic perception, machine learning, manipulation and human-robot interaction. He believes in the potential of using multimodal haptic signals to enhance robot manipulation capabilities in unstructured environments as well as around humans. He aims to achieve this by inferring relevant properties of the world using physics-based and data-driven methods.

              Sam Burden earned his BS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2008. He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California in Berkeley in 2014, where he subsequently spent one year as a Postdoctoral Scholar. In 2015, he returned to UW EE as an Assistant Professor; in 2016, he received a Young Investigator award from the Army Research Office (ARO-YIP). Sam is broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control. Specifically, he focuses on applications in dynamic and dexterous robotics, neuromechanical motor control, and human-cyber-physical systems. In his spare time, he teaches robotics to students of all ages in classrooms and campus events.
