    Abstract = {Verified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-based systems that are provably correct with respect to mathematically-specified requirements. This paper considers Verified AI from a formal methods perspective. We describe five challenges for achieving Verified AI, and five corresponding principles for addressing these challenges.}
