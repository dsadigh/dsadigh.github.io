 abstract = {We present a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis approach 
to controller synthesis for cyber-physical systems subject to signal temporal logic (STL) specifications, operating 
in potentially adversarial nondeterministic environments. We 
encode STL specifications as mixed integer-linear constraints 
on the variables of a discrete-time model of the system and 
environment dynamics, and solve a series of optimization 
problems to yield a satisfying control sequence. We demonstrate how the scheme can be used in a receding horizon 
fashion to fulfill properties over unbounded horizons, and 
present experimental results for reactive controller synthesis 
for case studies in building climate control and autonomous 
driving.},
