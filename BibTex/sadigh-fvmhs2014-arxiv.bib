    Abstract = {We address the problem of formally verifying quantitative
properties of driver models.We first propose a novel stochastic
model of the driver behavior based on Convex Markov
Chains, i.e., Markov chains in which the transition probabilities
are only known to lie in convex uncertainty sets. This formalism
captures the intrinsic uncertainty in estimating transition
probabilities starting from experimentally-collected data.
We then formally verify properties of the model expressed
in probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL). Results show
that our approach can correctly predict quantitative information
about driver behavior depending on his/her state, e.g.,
whether he or she is attentive or distracted.}
