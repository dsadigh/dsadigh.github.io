    Abstract = {We give an overview of the main challenges in the specification, 
design, and verification of human cyber-physical systems, with a 
special focus on semi-autonomous vehicles. We identify unique 
characteristics of formal modeling, specification, verification and 
synthesis in this domain. Some initial results and design principles 
are presented along with directions for future work.},
