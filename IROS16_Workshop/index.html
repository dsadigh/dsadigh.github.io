          Most of these new opportunities will require robotic systems to closely interact with human beings in their natural environments, which challenges the robotics community to look beyond its traditional assumptions. With rich predictive models of humans made available through recent research, and in the midst of increasingly powerful statistical methods, the time is finally ripe for robotics to deal with the elephant in the room: us.
          Of course, efforts are already underway. Yet, even as ongoing research in the young field of human-robot-interaction contributes a variety of valuable insights, it is not always clear how to translate these insights into general principles that can then be applied to robotic planning, verification, and control. On one hand, the knowledge gained from cognitive and behavioral studies needs to be condensed into actionable predictive models that can naturally integrate into existing frameworks to inform the design and operation of robotic systems. At the same time, the frameworks themselves will need to adapt in order to better accommodate and build on these models. This leaves questions such as which human models are appropriate, and how to formalize interactions between humans and robots.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when investigating a human-robot system, the choice of human model can dramatically change the conclusions that can be drawn from the composed system. Simple models (templates) often allow for faster computation while sacrificing the nuances of reality. More complex models (anchors) are better equipped to take these into account and can be used in a variety of circumstances, however can require intense computation.
          The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in industry and academia from different areas of robotics to hear their perspective on human-centered systems.  In principle, there are models and design techniques being developed for intelligent systems within each subfield (e.g. exoskeletons, autonomous vehicles, etc.) in isolation.  By looking at different perspectives on robotics in society, we can not only find common ground and apply these techniques to different human-robot systems, but also answer some of the remaining concerns in developing intelligent interactive systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Choosing a human model as well as a model of interaction and level of abstraction that facilitate smooth integration of humans into robotic systems.</li>
          <li> Exploiting the structure in these models to make better sense of the increasingly abundant data, and inform data collection.</li>
          <li> Merging data-driven and model-based techniques for the design of provably correct systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Channeling the combined predictive power of models and data into flexible planning and control algorithms will ultimately be crucial to provide desirable robot behavior, with performance and correctness guarantees, in the human space. This workshop will provide a combined view of some of the key existing technical methods for tackling parts of this problem and promote a multidisciplinary discussion to consolidate different perspectives and align research efforts.

           This workshop is intended to gather researchers from industry and academia to discuss problems in the area of human-centered robotics. We seek to bring together people from areas spanning human modeling, human-robot interaction, and robotic systems design.

           We open our workshop with perspectives on human modeling and how it should inform the analysis and design of human-robot systems. In a series of talks, we then learn about the relative merits of two modeling methodologies; template and anchor models will be discussed in relation to bio-inspired robotic locomotion. Highly detailed models that represent the full neuromuscular system will be explored, showing the potential for these methods to further our understanding of the neural basis of human motion. We then focus on the effects of these modeling methodologies on specific applications in grasping and human-robot interaction. We further discuss system design and analysis of human-centered robotics, including medical and surgical robots. We close our workshop with an open discussion hosting a panel of industry experts to gain additional perspectives on the future of human-centered robotics.
         </p>
         <p>
           The goal of the workshop is to contrast and connect different approaches to the analysis and design of human-centered systems, from both model-based and data-driven standpoints. We expect the technical content to attract researchers across the spectrum of human-robot systems, including human modeling, human-robot interaction, and system design.
